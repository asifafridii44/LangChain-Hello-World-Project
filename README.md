LangChain Hello World Project
This project demonstrates the integration of LangChain with Google Generative AI in a Colab environment. It provides an example of how to interact with AI models like gemini-2.0-flash-exp using the langchain-google-genai module.

Features
API Key Integration: Securely integrates Google AI API key using getpass.
LangChain Setup: Installs and configures LangChain for generative AI use cases.
Model Interaction: Showcases a sample query ("Who is Imran Khan?") using the ChatGoogleGenerativeAI interface.
Requirements
Google Colab
A valid Google AI API key
Python dependencies: langchain, langchain-google-genai
Getting Started
Clone the repository or upload the .ipynb file to your Colab environment.
Install the required Python packages.
Enter your Google AI API key when prompted.
Run the provided example or customize the queries.
Output Example
The project retrieves meaningful responses from the AI model based on the input queries.

Usage
This project is a starting point for developers looking to explore LangChain with Google's generative AI capabilities. It can be extended for applications such as:

Building conversational agents
Extracting insights from text
Experimenting with generative AI capabilities
